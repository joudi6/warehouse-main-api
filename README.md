## Documentation

Bellow is a detailed list of the used tools

### Language

`javascript` using [react](https://reactjs.org/) library

---

### Project architect

created client side app using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**Reason of choice**After waisting too much time on setting up a project using `webpack`, `babel`, `eslint`, etc... I decided to skip this step and use a boilerplate.

### Styled components

---

created components using [https://react-bootstrap.github.io/](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

**Reason of choice** reusable components to serve time
